# c-compiler
A C compiler...written in C++! It might seem weird to write a C compiler in C++, but it does actually work, and although it doesn't really make sense to do so, I did this to learn more about compilers and how they work!

## Architecture ##

This is going to follow the standard compiler architecture - lexing, parsing and code generation.
